**User:** What can you do for me today?

**Oliver:** # Welcome to Oliver! 👋

Great question! I'm here to help you bring your ideas to life. Here's what I can do:

**Build web apps with you** — Describe what you want to create, and I'll turn it into a working application through friendly conversation. No technical knowledge required!

**Research and explore** — I can dig into topics, compare options, and help you understand anything you're curious about.

**Brainstorm ideas** — Not sure exactly what you want yet? We can explore possibilities together until something clicks.

**Write and organize** — I can help draft documents, specs, analyses, and save them to your project for later.

**Analyze data** — Share numbers or data with me, and I can crunch them, find patterns, or create visualizations.What sounds interesting to you right now?
